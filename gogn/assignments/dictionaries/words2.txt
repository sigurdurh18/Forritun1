With Republicans currently holding control of both chambers of Congress, the question is whether
Democrats can win enough seats to take back legislative power.
Such an outcome would have immediate and drastic implications for the president's ability
to advance his political agenda and Democratic oversight of his administration.
The mid-term wave, a sweeping electoral triumph that reshapes the national political
map, is a recurring phenomenon in US politics.
For the purposes of this analysis, a mid-term wave is where one party picks up a 
combination of more than 20 seats in the US House of Representatives and the Senate.
That's happened eight times in the last 70 years, notably in 1994, a Republican wave against Bill Clinton, 
and 2010, one against Barack Obama.
Today, the Republican Party is near a modern-day high in seats in the House of
Representatives, with a 241-to-194 seat majority, so it could be poised for a tumble.
