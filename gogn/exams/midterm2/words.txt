Russian
spies
have
been
accused
of
involvement
in
a
series
of
cyber-plots
across
the
globe
,
leading
the
US
to
level
charges
against
seven
agents
.

The
US
justice
department
said
targets
included
the
global
chemical
weapons
watchdog
,
anti-doping
agencies
and
a
US
nuclear
company
.

The
allegations
are
part
of
an
organised
push-back
against
alleged
Russian
cyber-attacks
around
the
world
.

Russia
earlier
dismissed
the
allegations
as
"
Western
spy
mania
"
.

BBC
diplomatic
correspondent
James
Landale
says
the
revelations
are
astonishing
in
both
their
detail
and
their
openness
.

They
show
what
can
be
done
in
European
cities
when
they
are
targeted
by
what
officials
describe
as
"
malign
Russian
activities
"
,
he
adds
.
